## Tarot Card Reading

This project is simulating a tarot card reading, in which the user 👤 will interact
with the computer 🔮 (the tarot card reader). The user will schedule an appointment
with the receptionist 🐧. If the user checks in before their appointment time, the
receptionist will return the amount of time left before the appointment (the waiting time).
Once it is time for the appointment, however, the user will be sent to the tarot card reader.


## How To Launch

To begin the reading, first `javac Woo.java`, then `java Woo`. Type `schedule`
and follow the prompts. When it's time to check in, type `check in`. Continue to
follow the prompts.
